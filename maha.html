      According to a Shiva legend from the Shiva Purana, once, Brahma (the god
      of creation) and Vishnu (the god of preservation) had an argument over
      their supremacy.[2] To settle the debate, Shiva pierced the three worlds,
      appearing as a huge, infinite pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Brahma and
      Vishnu decided to ascend and descend across a pillar of light
      respectively, to find the end of the light in either direction. According
      to some iterations, Vishnu assumed his Varaha avatar to achieve this task,
      while Brahma rode a hamsa (swan).[3] Brahma lied that he had discovered
      the end of the light, producing a ketakī flower as proof, while Vishnu
      admitted that he could not find the end of the light from his journey.[4]
      The dishonesty of Brahma angered Shiva, causing him to curse the creator
      deity that he would not be worshipped; he also declared that Vishnu would
      be eternally worshipped for his honesty.[5] The jyotirlinga shrines are
      regarded to be the temples where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of
      light.[6][7]According to a Shiva legend from the Shiva Purana, once,
