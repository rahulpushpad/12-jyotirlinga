        Where is the Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga located? It is located in Ellora
        near Daulatabad in Maharashtra, India. History of Grishneshwar
        Jyotirlinga This temple has been mentioned in the Shiva Purana and Padma
        Purana. The site was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th-14th
        century AD. The temple was reconstructed by Maratha ruler Shivaji’s
        grandfather, Maloju Bhisale of Verul, in the 16th century AD. The
        current structure was built by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in the
        18th century AD after the fall of the Mughal Empire. Special features of
        Grishneshwar Temple The temple, built of red rocks, is composed of a
        five-tier spire or shikara. You can see the Dashavatars (ten avatars) of
        Lord Vishnu carved in red stone. There is a court hall built on 24
        pillars on which you will find carvings of various legends and
        mythologies of Lord Shiva. The sanctum houses the east-facing linga. You
        will also find a statue of Lord Shiva’s mount, Nandi, the bull in the
        court hall. What is the story behind Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga? There are
        a couple of legends associated with this jyotirlinga. One legend says
        that there was once a woman named Kusuma, who would worship Lord Shiva
        every day, immersing the Shiva Linga in a tank along with her prayers.
        Her husband’s first wife was jealous of her devotion and murdered her
        son. Although Kusuma was grief-stricken, she kept up her faith and her
        devotion to the Lord. It is said that Lord Shiva was so pleased with her
        devotion that he brought her son back to life. Kusuma requested the Lord
        to stay on, which is why Lord Shiva manifested himself as a jyotirlinga
        here. Another legend has it that there was a Brahmin called Brahmavetta
        Sudharm, who lived with his wife Sudeha in the Devagiri mountains. The
        couple was childless, so Sudeha got her sister Ghushma married to her
        husband. On her sister’s advice, Ghushma would make lingas, worship
        them, and immerse them in the lake nearby. She was, finally, blessed
        with a baby boy. Over time, Sudeha became jealous of her sister and
        murdered her son and threw him into the very lake where her sister would
        immerse the lingas. Though Ghushma’s daughter-in-law told her that
        Sudeha had a hand in the murder of her son, Ghushma continued her daily
        rituals believing totally in the Lord’s mercy. And true to her beliefs,
        as she went to immerse the linga, she saw her son walking towards her.
        Lord Shiva appeared before her and told her of her sister’s heinous
        deed. Ghushma requested the Lord to forgive her sister. Pleased, the
        Lord granted her a boon. She asked him to stay on in that place, which
        is why he manifested himself as a jyotirlinga called Ghushmeshwar. The
        lake in which Ghushma immersed the lingas was called Shivalaya.
        Interesting facts about Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga Grishneshwar is also
        called Ghushmeshwar and Kusumeshwar. Men are required to go bare-chested
        into the temple. This is the smallest jyotirlinga temple in India. The
        UNESCO World Heritage site, Ellora caves, is less than a kilometer away.
        While you can visit this spiritual spot at any time in the year, it
        would be best to visit it during the winter months – between October and
        March. Visiting this ancient and divine destination during Mahashivratri
        would be the ultimate treat for any devotee!
